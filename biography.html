        <h2>Hi, Welcome to My Top Feats Page.</h2>

        <p>

          Some of the notable things that I have accomplished in my life are:

          Shooting a 155mm Howitzer. This is a cannon in the US Army that shoots a 100lb round up to 30mi away.

          I have also participated and helped my local community. In 2020, the state declared an emergency because of the outbreak of Covid-19. 
          My unit was activated to set up a hospital in Louisville. We set up over 250 beds so that we could take non-covid patients away from real hospitals, so that the hospitals could focus on fighting COVID-19.
